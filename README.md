*Projects presented thus far:*

1. PokemonReviewApp

    > *Web API, MVC, CRUD*

    - Based on the following YouTube tutorial, [ASP.NET Core Web API .NET 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8nLSsK5NDo&list=PL82C6-O4XrHdiS10BLh23x71ve9mQCln0)

    What is different from tutorial:
   - *.NET 8* instead of *.NET 6*
   - Object mapping instead of `AutoMapper`
